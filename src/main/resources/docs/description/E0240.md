The method resolution order is used primarily to obtain the order (linearization) in which methods should
be inherited in presence of multiple inheritance. This error is shown when we can't determine a sane and
consistent order that respects the principle of local precedence order and monotonicity.

For instance, the following example doesn't respect the expected linearization and it will lead to a
runtime crash:


    class Str(str):
        pass

    class Inconsistent(str, Str):
        pass
