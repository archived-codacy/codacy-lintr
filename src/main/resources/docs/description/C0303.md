The [PEP 8: Programming Recommendations]
(http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations)
mentions trailing whitespaces on a line only in context of split strings:

    Don't write string literals that rely on significant trailing whitespace. Such trailing whitespace is visually indistinguishable and some editors will trim them.
