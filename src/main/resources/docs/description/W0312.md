Used when there are some mixed tabs and spaces in a module.
Python interprets tabs and spaces differently, so consistent indentation is critical to the correct interpretation of blocks in Python syntax.  This warning is raised when a mix of both spaces and tabs is used in indentationâ€”or more precisely, when an indent is detected that is not consistent with the indent-string option. By default, indent-string is set to four spaces, the style of indentation recommended in PEP 8 .
