Emitted when the staticmethod builtin is not used as a decorator.
One can declare a staticmethod using the old idiom, as seen in this example:

    def method():
        ...
    method = staticmethod(method)

But it's much cleaner and obvious to use the decorator form for defining it:

    @staticmethod
    def method():
        ...
