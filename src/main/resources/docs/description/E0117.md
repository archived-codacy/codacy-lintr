This error is emitted when a nonlocal statement is found with some binding names,
but these names weren't found in the enclosing scopes.

For instance, in the following example, there is no name **bar** available,
which will result in a runtime error.


    def func():
        ba = 42
        def some_other_function():
            nonlocal bar
