Emitted when the classmethod builtin is not used as a decorator.
One can declare a classmethod using the old idiom, as seen in this example:

    def method(cls):
        ...
    method = classmethod(method)

But it's much cleaner and obvious to use the decorator form for defining it:

    @classmethod
    def method(cls):
        ...
