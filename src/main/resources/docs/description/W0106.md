When an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing, something else is probably intended.

For example:

    foo = list()

    def sum(a, b):
        c = a + b
        return c

    bar_list = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

    [foo.append(sum(i, x)) for i, x in enumerate(bar_list)]  # adding to foo but assigning nothing

    foo = [sum(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(bar_list)]  # assigning to foo
