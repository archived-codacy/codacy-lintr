In Python 2.x, old-style classes are defined by not inheriting from a base class or by inheriting from other old-style classes.
New-style classes are defined by inheriting from class object or from other new-style classes.

Python 3.x supports only new-style classes; if no base class is specified on a class definition, the class implicitly inherits from object.

It is recommended to define only new-style classes, because they are properly integrated into Python's type system.
See [Python docs article: New-Style Classes](http://www.python.org/doc/newstyle/) for details.
