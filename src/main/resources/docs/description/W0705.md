Used when an exception clause catches an exception which was previously handled by another exception clause.

This can lead to subtle bugs, as we can see in the following code, where the second except clause
will not be taken.

    try:
        obj.do_operation()
    except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
        ...
    except NotImplementedError:
        LOG.debug("Operation not implemented")
