It is customary for instance or class methods to take self or cls , respectively, as their first arguments, a method that uses either of these names but is found to be a static method may have been defined incorrectly.
Static methods, are class methods, not methods of the object itself, so self does not exist in a static context.

The problem exists when you name a normal variable as self or cls, doing this may be confusing. You should be mindful of the convention above and choose names other than self or cls for arguments. It will improve your code readbility.
