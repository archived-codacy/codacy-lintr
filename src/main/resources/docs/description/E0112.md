The star operator can be used to unpack a subset of values into one variable in
assignments, as seen in the following example.

    head, *tail = [1, 2, 3]

Here, **head** becomes the first value of the right hand side, while **tail**
will contain the rest of them. It's a syntax error to use multiple star
operators in a tuple assignment.
