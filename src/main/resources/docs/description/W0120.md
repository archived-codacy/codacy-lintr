Loops should only have an `else` clause if they can exit early with a `break` statement,
 otherwise the statements under `else` should be on the same scope as the loop itself.

For example:

    data = [1, 2]

    for x in data:
        print("doing")
        if x == 1:
            print("found")
    else:
        print("done")

    for x in data:
        print("doing")
        if x == 1:
            break
    else:
        print("done")
