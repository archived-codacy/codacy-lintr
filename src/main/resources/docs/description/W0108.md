Prohibit `lambda` expressions where the body of a `lambda` expression is a function call on the same argument list as the `lambda` itself.
These lambdas are replaceable with the function being called in the body of the `lambda`.

For example:

    def foo():
        return 42

    f = lambda: foo()  # should be f = foo
