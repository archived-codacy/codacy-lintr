Used when a statement is endend by a semi-colon (";"), which isn't necessary.
Semicolons are not necessary in Python unless you are putting more than one statement in a line (which is a poor idea anyway).  This is a style slip-up that's particularly easy to make for old hands of other programming languages such as C or Perl, where semicolons are always (or almost always) required after each statement.
